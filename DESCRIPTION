Description: Fits zeta distributions (discrete power laws) to data that arises
    from forensic surveys of clothing on the presence of glass and paint in
    various populations. The general method is described to some extent in
    Coulson, S.A., Buckleton, J.S., Gummer, A.B., and Triggs, C.M. (2001) 
    <doi:10.1016/S1355-0306(01)71847-3>, although the implementation differs.
